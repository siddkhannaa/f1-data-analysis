repo to store my f1 data science stuff
2023 TL;DR
- VER kingdom (19 of 22 gp wins)
- RB19 has become (statistically) the best car in F1 (won 21 of 22 gps)

2024 TL;DR
- no driver changes from 2023 -> 2024, results will mainly depend on any constructor improvements
- mercedes falling off?
- aston improving (ALO at least..)
- FER trying to catch RBR
